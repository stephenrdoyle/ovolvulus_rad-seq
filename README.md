# ovolvulus_rad-seq

This repository contains the analysis workflow for a project focused on describing the population genetic diversity of the filarial nematode *Onchocerca volvulus* in Ghana. 

Part of the motivation of this work is to determine if there is genetic structure corresponding to transmission zones based on river basin (Daka, Tombe, Pru and Black Volta), 
and to determine if there are genetic differences between phenotypically-defined parasites based on their response to ivermectin. There are 181 samples in total, with 104 
defined as "good responders", 39 moderate responders, 35 poor responders, and 3 very poor responders.  

DNA was extracted from archival samples by Sam Armoo in Ghana, before individual RAD-seq libraries were prepared by SRD and sequneced on two MiSeq lanes.
